This event is part of the <a href="https://events.hifis.net/event/1167/overview" style="text-decoration: underline">Helmholtz Imaging Annual Conference 2024</a> in Heidelberg.
This conference is tailored for scientists and researchers engaged in imaging research or utilizing imaging techniques.
<br>
We're excited to share one of the keynotes of this conference with the Heidelberg AI community!
<br>
<br>
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses one of the most critical concerns in the adoption of AI technologies: transparency. XAI seeks to make the decision-making processes of AI systems clear and understandable to human users. This transparency is vital for building trust, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where understanding AI’s decision process is crucial for acceptance and ethical considerations.
<br>
This research is particularly crucial when applied to large vision-language models, which are increasingly used to handle complex tasks that involve understanding and generating content from both visual and textual data.
<!-- Uncertainty estimation is crucial in many areas, from medical applications to self-driving cars and weather forecasting, to allow the widespread use of machine learning models.
<br>
We are excited to have David Stutz, a research scientist at <a href="https://deepmind.google"  style="text-decoration: underline">Google DeepMind</a>, in our joint Heidelberg.ai / NCT Data Science Seminar series.
In this online seminar, David Stutz will talk about conformal prediction, a method to give rigorous uncertainties to machine learning models, and how to extend it to cases where even the ground truth data is uncertain.
<br>
<br>
We look forward to your participation, as this seminar will equip us with the knowledge to enhance the safety of our machine-learning models, making them even more reliable. -->

<h2 class="section-heading">Announcement</h2>
Professor Akata will not be able to attend the conference in person. 
Therefore, her talk will be live-streamed at the event.

<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
<p>
<!-- Put Abstract Here -->
In this talk, Professor Zeynep Akata delves into the transformative impacts of representation learning, foundation models, and explainable AI on machine learning technologies. 
She highlights how these approaches enhance the adaptability, transparency, and ethical alignment of AI systems across various applications. 
Professor Akata will address the synergy between these technologies and their crucial role in advancing AI, aiming to make these complex systems more accessible and understandable.
