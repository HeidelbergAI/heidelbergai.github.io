The COVID-19 pandemic has been a defining global health crisis, impacting every aspect of our lives. It underscored the urgent need for more sophisticated tools in predicting and managing infectious disease outbreaks. 
<br>
<br>
We are excited to have Prof. Joacim Rocklöv, leading the first AI lab in Germany addressing global infectious diseases and climate change issues.
During his talk, he will go into detail how to leverage AI for surveillance and prediction of infectious disease outbreaks. 
<br>
<br>
We hope to see you there, learning with us about the latest on AI and infectious disease outbreak prediction.

<!-- This talk delves into the rules that dictate how systems evolve over time, using what's known as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These equations provide a blueprint for understanding changes in systems. To kick things off, we'll see an introduction to how these "rules" are deduced from observed behaviors. The talk will encompass various methods, from the more abstract blackbox models to the transparent symbolic techniques. A core aspect of this discussion is understanding the reliability and accuracy of these methods, particularly when faced with both familiar and new scenarios. Finally recent attempts to extract these equations from imperfect real-world data are described. -->
