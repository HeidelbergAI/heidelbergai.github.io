<!-- Put Abstract Here -->
Foundation models have changed how we develop medical AI. These powerful models, trained on massive datasets using self-supervised learning, are adaptable to diverse medical tasks with minimal additional data and paved the way for the development of generalist medical AI systems. In this talk we will explore the capabilities of these models from medical image analysis, to polygenic risk scoring, and aiding in therapeutic development. Additionally, we will discuss the future of generalist and generative models in healthcare and science.
