We would like to welcome you all to the next online talk in our joint Heidelberg.ai / NCT Data Science Seminar series. 

<h2 class="section-heading">Online-only Event</h2><br> 

We are excited to have Qi Dou. She is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Her research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of AI for healthcare with expertise in medical image analysis and robot-assisted surgery towards the goal of advancing disease diagnosis and intervention via machine intelligence.

<p>
<!-- Put Abstract Here -->
With rapid advancements in medicine and engineering technologies, the operating room has evolved to a highly complex environment, where surgeons take advantage of computers, endoscopes and robots to perform procedures with more precision while less incision. Intelligence, together with its authorized cognitive assistance, smart data analytics, and automation, is envisaged to be a core fuel to transform next-generation robotic surgery in numerous known or unknown exciting ways. In this talk, I will present ideas, methodologies and applications of image-based robotic surgery intelligence from three perspectives, i.e., AI-enabled surgical situation awareness to improve surgical procedures, AI-powered large-scale data analysis to enhance surgical education, AI-driven multi-sensory perception to achieve surgical subtask automation.
