We are excited to host Alan Karthikesalingam, a senior staff clinical research scientist leading research at Google Health.
He has worked on several large-scale studies with the goal of
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-019-1426-2" style="text-decoration: underline">
  integrating Artificial Intelligence into the clinical workflow
</a>.
We are big admirers of his work, especially so his works on
<a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10056194/1/Diagnosis%20and%20referral%20in%20retinal%20disease%20-%20updated.pdf" style="text-decoration: underline">
  diagnosis of retinal diseases based on OCT Retina Scans
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6.pdf?origin=ppub" style="text-decoration: underline">
  breast cancer screenings with AI systems
</a>
.
Especially the focus on rigid evaluation to ensure safety in the application seems to be of great importance.
<!-- In his work he aims to bring artificial intelligence into the clinic and has worked on several large scale studies:
1. Clinically applicable deep learning for diagnosis and referral in retinal disease (eye referral recommendation)
2. International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening (large scale international study showing benefit of AI methods) -->

<h2 class="section-heading">Biography</h2>
<p>
  Alan is a senior staff clinical research scientist in Google Health who leads the clinical team's translational research efforts, with a particular focus on bridging new ML developments and health-oriented research. He focuses on machine learning for medical imaging across multiple fields: radiology, ophthalmology and dermatology, with interests in AI safety, robustness and data-efficiency for realising real-world clinical impact. Alan is an honorary Lecturer in Vascular Surgery at Imperial College in London where he continues to see patients and supervise PhD students. He did his MA in Neuroscience and Medical Degree (MBBChir) at the University of Cambridge, followed by specialist training in surgery in the London Deanery, where he completed his Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS), PhD in Vascular Surgery and was appointed as a NIHR Clinical Lecturer. In 2017 he joined DeepMind's health research team and in 2019 joined Google Health. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed articles, including first-author studies in the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet prior to DeepMind/Google, where he subsequently co-authored landmark papers in Nature and Nature Medicine on deep learning systems for mammography, ophthalmology and electronic health records.

        Simon is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind, where he works on AlphaFold2 and problems in structural biology. 
        Before joining DeepMind he was a PhD student at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany, where he developed generative models for biomedical image segmentation.
        Broadly, Simon is interested in developing deep, often generative, neural networks for natural science and real world applications. 
        His research is often concerned with uncertainty quantification and the generation of multi-modal outputs in problems that allow multiple solutions.
